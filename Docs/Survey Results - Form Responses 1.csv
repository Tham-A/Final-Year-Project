In other words, to increase visibiility the charts should give each team unique colors. Furthermore, for the stacked bar chart I think it would make more sense to have each team next to each other as initially I was unsure if the different colors were unique or was the total.

In regards to the bar chart (animation) I think that it could be further improvde by provide a slider near the top as well as a play button so that a user could either have the animation play on its own or manually select specific times. This is because I had to wait around 20 seconds to view the bar chart at the 20 minute mark and also there was no way of pausing to view the detailed information.","In terms of the UI there two aspects that I think could be improved. The first is the font which looks like it may be the default browser font. So using a custom font would make the website look better. Additionally, the background might be a little too destraction so I would either make the background slightly darker or to use a more muted color."

On the last visualisor ""ROX"" name is outside the box even with space available when it goes to negative gold throughout the visualisor from the beginning to end. Towards the end you can clearly see it more. at around 60 minutes","Place the steps above the visualisors so people clearly know what to do first before even touching the visualisor.

With the instruction box cut the sides so only the sentence completely fills out the box  or maybe place the instructions in the middle so there is space on both sides. "
